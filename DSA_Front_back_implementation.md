### **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Usage in Frontend and Backend**

## **Frontend (React) DSA Usage**

1. **Arrays / Lists**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Store and render collections of tweets, comments, notifications, and followers.  
     - Example: Rendering lists of tweets dynamically as the user scrolls (infinite scrolling).  
   - **Implementation:**  
     - `useState` to manage state arrays, map functions for rendering lists.

2. **Stacks**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Implement **undo/redo** functionality in text editors (e.g., tweet drafts).
     - Browser history management when navigating between pages.  
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Store drafts or input changes using JavaScript stacks.

3. **Queues (FIFO)**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - **Notification queue**: Handle pop-up notifications, processing them one by one.  
     - **Messages queue**: Simulate real-time messages waiting to be processed or displayed.  
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use JavaScript arrays as queues (push/pop).

4. **Hash Maps (Objects)**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Cache user information (username, profile picture) locally to reduce redundant API calls.
     - Store **key-value pairs** for managing component states and rendering optimizations.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use JavaScript objects to store cached data efficiently.

5. **Binary Search**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Search through **sorted lists** (e.g., search users, hashtags, or tweets).  
     - Optimize **autocomplete** by finding matching prefixes quickly.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Implement custom binary search functions on sorted data.

6. **Sorting Algorithms**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Sort tweets by **timestamp** for displaying the timeline.
     - Sort followers or messages alphabetically or by date.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use JavaScriptâ€™s built-in `sort()` method for arrays.

7. **Graphs** (Conceptual Implementation)  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Handle **social connections** (e.g., following/followers) in the UI.
     - Navigate through relationships for displaying mutual followers or suggestions.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use **adjacency lists** to represent and render follower/following relationships dynamically.

## **Backend (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Redis) DSA Usage**

1. **Hash Tables / Hash Maps**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Store **sessions and JWT tokens** in Redis for fast lookups.
     - Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user profiles, tweet counts).
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use Redis (hash-based data structure) to manage cache.
     - Store JWT tokens as key-value pairs for session management.

2. **Arrays / Lists**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Handle collections of tweets, comments, and followers in APIs.
     - Store multiple records from SQL queries and pass them as responses.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use **Java Lists or Arrays** to manage data collections within Spring Boot services.

3. **Linked Lists**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Manage **profile update history** or changes in tweets.
     - Handle **pagination**: Store pointers to next/previous pages of tweets.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use **linked list implementations** for sequential data updates.

4. **Queues (FIFO)**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Manage **notifications** and **event-driven messages** using Kafka or Google Pub/Sub.
     - Handle asynchronous operations like sending email confirmations or notifications.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use **Java Queues** and integrate with **Kafka or Pub/Sub** for messaging.

5. **Graphs**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Model **user relationships** (Follow/Unfollow) with graphs.
     - Implement recommendations (e.g., "People you may know") based on mutual connections.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use **adjacency lists** in SQL with **JOIN queries** to model user relationships.

6. **Binary Search Trees / B-Trees**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Handle database indexing to optimize search queries (e.g., users, tweets).
   - **Implementation:**  
     - **PostgreSQL uses B-trees** for indexing tables.

7. **Sharded Counters (Distributed Counting)**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Manage **likes, retweets, and views** efficiently at scale using sharded counters.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use **Redis counters** or sharded counters in Cloud Datastore to distribute the load.

8. **Sorting Algorithms**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Sort tweets or notifications by **timestamp**.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Sort data within **SQL queries** or backend logic before sending responses.

9. **Consistent Hashing**  
   - **Use Case:**  
     - Implement **load balancing** to distribute traffic between multiple backend services.
   - **Implementation:**  
     - Use consistent hashing algorithms in backend code or via **Cloud Run** load balancing.

### **Conclusion**

- **Frontend (React)** focuses more on **UI state management** with arrays, stacks, and queues to handle tweets, notifications, and history.  
- **Backend (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Redis)** emphasizes efficient **caching, search, event-driven processing**, and **graph relationships** to ensure scalability and performance.  
This combination gives students practical experience with real-world use cases of DSA across both the frontend and backend, enhancing their understanding of **distributed systems, caching strategies, and search optimization.**
