# **Comprehensive Plan for Twitter-like Application with DSA and System Design**

This plan ensures that students can **work independently in a local setup**, while the instructor **demos advanced cloud concepts** using their code in cloud environments. All cloud services are replaced with **local alternatives**, ensuring continuity in learning without dependency on the internet or cloud access. Below is the **week-by-week breakdown** with objectives, student focus, and local alternatives.

---
