## **Component Descriptions**

### **Users (Clients)**

- Users access the application via web browsers or mobile apps.
- Interact with the frontend interface built with React.

### **Load Balancer (Nginx)**

- Distributes incoming HTTPS requests across multiple backend servers.
- Implements load balancing algorithms like Round Robin or Least Connections.
- Can handle SSL termination.

### **Backend Servers (Spring Boot Applications)**

- Hosts the application's RESTful APIs.
- Handles authentication, business logic, and data processing.
- Scales horizontally by running multiple instances.

### **Redis Cache**

- Stores session data and frequently accessed information.
- Improves performance by reducing database load.

### **PostgreSQL Database**

- Stores persistent data such as user profiles, tweets, and relationships.
- Utilizes indexing and optimized queries for performance.

### **Storage (FileSystem)**

- Manages file uploads like profile pictures and media.
- Files are stored in a designated directory on the server.

### **Kafka Message Queue**

- Handles asynchronous communication between services.
- Used for real-time features like notifications and timeline updates.

### **Monitoring (Zipkin)**

- Collects and analyzes tracing data for monitoring and debugging.
- Helps in identifying performance bottlenecks and latency issues.

## **Data Flow Explanation**

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users perform actions on the frontend application.
   - Actions include logging in, posting tweets, following users, etc.

2. **Request Routing:**
   - The frontend sends HTTPS requests to the Load Balancer.
   - The Load Balancer forwards the requests to one of the Backend Servers.

3. **Backend Processing:**
   - Backend Server processes the request.
   - Interacts with Redis for caching and session management.
   - Communicates with PostgreSQL for data persistence.
   - Uses Kafka for publishing or consuming messages for asynchronous tasks.
   - Stores or retrieves files from the FileSystem for media content.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Backend Servers send tracing data to Zipkin.
   - Zipkin collects and visualizes the performance data.

5. **Response Delivery:**
   - Backend Server sends the response back through the Load Balancer.
   - Load Balancer forwards the response to the user.

## **Notes on Diagram Representation**

- **Multiple Backend Servers:**
  - Illustrates horizontal scaling.
  - Each server has its own instance of Redis and connects to shared databases and services.

- **Shared Services:**
  - PostgreSQL, Storage, Kafka, and Zipkin can be shared among backend servers.
  - For simplicity, they are shown connected to individual servers, but in practice, they could be centralized.

- **Connections:**
  - Arrows represent the flow of data and requests.
  - Vertical connections show the interaction between layers.

## **Simplified Flow Diagram**

```plaintext
Clients
   |
Load Balancer (Nginx)
   |
Backend Servers (Spring Boot)
   |
+----+----+----+
|    |    |    |
Redis  PostgreSQL  Storage
Cache   Database   (FileSystem)
   |      |       |
   +------+------+----+
                 |
               Kafka
           Message Queue
                 |
               Zipkin
            Monitoring
```

## **Explanation of Simplified Flow**

- **Clients** interact with the system through the **Load Balancer**.
- **Load Balancer** routes requests to available **Backend Servers**.
- **Backend Servers** perform the core processing and interact with:
  - **Redis Cache** for fast data retrieval.
  - **PostgreSQL Database** for persistent storage.
  - **Storage (FileSystem)** for managing media files.
- **Kafka Message Queue** handles messaging and event-driven tasks.
- **Zipkin Monitoring** collects tracing information from backend servers.

## **Key Points**

- **Load Balancing:**
  - Ensures high availability and scalability.
- **Caching:**
  - Improves performance by reducing database load.
- **Persistent Storage:**
  - PostgreSQL and the FileSystem store essential data reliably.
- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  - Kafka enables decoupled communication for real-time features.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Zipkin provides insights into system performance and aids in debugging.
